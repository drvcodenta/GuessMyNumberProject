# GuessMyNumberProject

The basic idea of the project is to create a simple game where the computer generates a random number, and the player has to guess that number within a certain range(1-20).

Guess the number between 1 to 20
The game randomly generates a number between 1 and 20, and you have to guess which one is generated!
"Guess My Number" project is a common beginner-level programming project often used to practice fundamental programming concepts

In this example:

The secret number is generated randomly between 1 and 20.
The player inputs their guess into an input field.
The checkGuess function is called when the player clicks the "Submit Guess" button.
The function compares the player's guess to the secret number and provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
